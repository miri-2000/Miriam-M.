# Welcome to my Github repository! Here you can see the things I am working on:

## CRISPR screen analysis pipeline
For my last project I wrote a CRISPR screen analysis pipeline in Python and R to identify genes that can promote or sensitize cancer cells to treatment. As a template, the pipeline written by Cor Lieftink and Roderick Beijersbergen from the Netherlands Cancer Institute. They have given me written consent to publish my adaptation to their code. Furthermore, this pipeline contains the DrugZ code that has been adapted for extra functionality. As stated by the MIT license, I am allowed to freely modify this code and publish it which I did in this repository.
